# Commit 1: Initial commit with configuration
* React Native Latest Stable version: "0.80.1"
  Reason: As per requirement.
* Chose Bare Workflow for more flexibility.
  Reason: Although Expo can reduce development time, But Expo has size and performance overhead and features comes months later at expo. Real Application need every bit of advantage to shine. 
* Keep Typescript enabled. 
  Reason: As per requirement and collaborating on typescript is much easier. It creates less error on runtime and save development time when code base got bigger.
* Move to Yarn for Package Management.
  Reason: Personal Preferance.
