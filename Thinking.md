# Commit 1: Initial commit with configuration
* React Native Latest Stable version: "0.80.1"
  Reason: As per requirement.
* Chose Bare Workflow for more flexibility.
  Reason: Although Expo can reduce development time, But Expo has size and performance overhead and features comes months later at expo. Real Application need every bit of advantage to shine. 
* Keep Typescript enabled. 
  Reason: As per requirement and collaborating on typescript is much easier. It creates less error on runtime and save development time when code base got bigger.
* Move to Yarn for Package Management.
  Reason: Personal Preferance. 

# Commit 2: Script Updated, New Arch Enabled, Update Git Ignore & README.md
* Git ignore updated.
  Reason: It won't change the build file again and again by my device configuration on each push. Collaborators can build once and run almost every version of git code without building again.
* New Architecture & Hermes Engine Enabled.
  Reason: Faster build and faster run. Who don't want the best performance on their application!
* Script Updated.
  Reason: Make my life easier by running command faster without remembering it.
* README.md Updated with project setup instructions & Environment configuration.
  Reason: As per requirement and best practices.
